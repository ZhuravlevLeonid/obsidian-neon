## Disclaimer

An educational project to gain practical skills in working with Open Source projects. The repository of the author @kepano was taken as a basis: [MinimalTheme] https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal

This theme is provided "as is" and is intended for my personal use of Obsidian on macOS and Windows. For this reason, it has not been thoroughly tested in all operating systems and use cases.

This theme changes large parts of the Obsidian interface, so it may not work in future updates. It may also be incompatible with other custom CSS you have.

## Companion plugins

- [Minimal Theme Settings plugin](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal-settings) allows you to customize color schemes, fonts, [hotkeys](#hotkeys), and access the main feature toggles. This plugin is highly recommended for all users of Minimal.
- [Hider plugin](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-hider) is recommended to hide Obsidian UI elements such as window frame, scrollbars, tooltips, etc. When using Hider to turn off the main toolbar (AKA app ribbon), it can be accessed by hovering over the bottom left edge of the window.
- [Style Settings plugin](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) allows you to create a custom color scheme. This plugin is optional.

## Settings

The following settings can be accessed using [Minimal Theme Settings](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal-settings) plugin. Many of these settings below can be toggled with [hotkeys](#hotkeys).

### Custom color schemes

You can use the Style Settings plugin to customize your color scheme. To see your changes more easily, open Style Settings in a new pane by using the command palette (`CMD + P` by default). Using Style Settings you can customize Minimal's colors, font sizes, font styles, and many more details.

## Helper filters and classes

## Image filters

Image filters can be added to create the following effects. Use them by adding the filter name at the end of the image link, e.g. `![[image.jpeg#invert]]`

| Filter     | Description                                                                        |
| :--------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `#invert`  | Invert images in dark mode — ideal for charts and handwriting on light backgrounds |
| `#invertW` | Invert images in light mode — ideal for charts and handwriting on dark backgrounds |
| `#circle`  | Crop image to a circle                                                             |
| `#outline` | Add outline around image                                                           | 

## CSS helper classes

CSS helper classes can be added on a per-file basis using the `cssClasses` [YAML front matter key](https://help.obsidian.md/Advanced+topics/YAML+front+matter). These classes are composable, so you can include more than one to combine effects.

For example, use the following code at the top of your file to enable cards layout: 
```
---
cssClasses: cards
---
```

### Plugin support

Plugin authors and developers can add support for Minimal theme by submitting a pull request. See the [src/scss/plugins](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal/tree/master/src/scss/plugins) folder with examples of snippets for plugins that are currently supported.

## Developers

### Build instructions

**Set up**

```
sudo gem install sass
npm install -g grunt-cli
npm install
```

**Define local path**

To build directly into your Obsidian vault rename `.env.example` to `.env` and update `OBSIDIAN_PATH` to the local path of your Obsidian theme folder.

**To run**

```
npx grunt
```

This builds two files, the `obsidian.css` distribution file (for the community themes store) which is minified and also copied to your vault for live reload, and the `Minimal.css` file which is an unminified copy saved to the project root.
