## Disclaimer

An educational project to gain practical skills in working with Open Source projects. The repository of the author @kepano was taken as a basis: [MinimalTheme] https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal

This theme is provided "as is" and is intended for my personal use of Obsidian on macOS and Windows. For this reason, it has not been thoroughly tested in all operating systems and use cases.

This theme changes large parts of the Obsidian interface, so it may not work in future updates. It may also be incompatible with other custom CSS you have.
